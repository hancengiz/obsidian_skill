## Overview

This skill equips Claude with the ability to interact with your Obsidian vault programmatically, enabling workflows like:
- Searching and analyzing your knowledge base
- Creating and updating notes with proper Obsidian formatting
- Managing daily/periodic notes
- Executing Dataview queries
- Organizing and linking notes
- Batch processing operations

## Prerequisites

### 1. Obsidian with Local REST API Plugin

You need Obsidian with the [Local REST API plugin](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api) installed and enabled.

**Installation**:
1. Open Obsidian
2. Go to Settings → Community Plugins
3. Disable Safe Mode (if enabled)
4. Click "Browse" and search for "Local REST API"
5. Install and Enable the plugin
6. Go to plugin settings and copy your API key

### 2. API Configuration

The skill requires an API key to authenticate with your Obsidian vault. Configuration is loaded in priority order (first found wins):

#### Configuration Priority

1. **Environment Variables** (Highest Priority)
2. **Project .env File** (Second Priority)
3. **User Home Config File** (Lowest Priority)

#### Option 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)

**Temporary (current session)**:
```bash
export OBSIDIAN_SKILL_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
export OBSIDIAN_SKILL_API_URL='https://localhost:27124'  # Optional, defaults to this
```

**Permanent (add to shell config)**:
```bash
# For zsh (macOS default)
echo 'export OBSIDIAN_SKILL_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# For bash
echo 'export OBSIDIAN_SKILL_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

#### Option 2: Project .env File

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```
apiKey=your-api-key-here
apiUrl=https://localhost:27124
```

**Note**: No `OBSIDIAN_SKILL_` prefix in .env files. The prefix is only used for environment variables.

**Important**: Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to prevent committing secrets!

#### Option 3: User Home Config File

Create `~/.cc_obsidian/config.json` in your home directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cc_obsidian
cat > ~/.cc_obsidian/config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "apiKey": "your-api-key-here",
  "apiUrl": "https://localhost:27124"
}
EOF
```

This provides user-level defaults that work across all projects without environment variables.

### Verify Installation

After installation, test the skill by asking:
- "Can you search my Obsidian vault?"
- "Read my daily note"

The skill should activate automatically when you mention Obsidian.

## Usage

Once installed, simply ask Claude to interact with your vault:

### Basic Examples

**Search your vault**:
```
Search my Obsidian vault for notes about machine learning
```

**Read a note**:
```
Read the note at "Projects/AI Research.md" and summarize it
```

**Create a new note**:
```
Create a new note called "Meeting Notes 2025-01-10" with a summary of our discussion
```

**Update a note**:
```
Add today's learnings to my daily note
```

**Dataview queries**:
```
Use Dataview to find all notes tagged with #important from the last week
```

### Advanced Workflows

**Knowledge graph analysis**:
```
Analyze my notes on topic X and create a summary note with connections to related notes
```

**Daily note automation**:
```
Create today's daily note using my template and add a task list for the day
```

**Batch processing**:
```
Find all notes in the "Archive" folder and update their frontmatter to include an "archived: true" field
```

## Configuration

### API Endpoints

By default, the skill connects to:
- **HTTPS**: `https://localhost:27124` (default)
- **HTTP**: `http://localhost:27123`

You can override this with the `OBSIDIAN_API_URL` environment variable.

### SSL/HTTPS

The Local REST API uses self-signed certificates for HTTPS. The skill handles this automatically by setting `verify=False` in requests. For production use, consider:
- Adding the certificate to your system trust store
- Using the HTTP endpoint if local security is acceptable
- Configuring a proper SSL certificate

### Vault Permissions

By default, the skill can access your entire vault. To restrict access:
1. Modify the `CLAUDE.md` file to add path restrictions
2. Or tell Claude which folders to avoid (e.g., ".obsidian", "Templates")

### Components

1. **`SKILL.md`**: Skill definition with:
   - YAML frontmatter (name, description)
   - System instructions with API details
   - Code examples and best practices
   - When to activate proactively

2. **`docs/`**: Complete documentation:
   - `openapi.yaml`: Official API specification (2080 lines, 31 endpoints)
   - `api-endpoints.md`: All endpoints with use case scenarios
   - `destructive-operation-list.md`: All 17 destructive operations with risk levels
   - `ADR-001-skill-architecture.md`: Architecture Decision - Initial design
   - `ADR-002-destructive-operation-guardrails.md`: Architecture Decision - Safety guardrails

3. **README.md**: This file - setup, usage, and documentation

## Alternative Integration Methods

This skill uses the **Local REST API** approach, which is HTTP-based and works with any tool that can make HTTP requests.

### Other Options

If the REST API doesn't fit your workflow, consider these alternatives:

#### 1. MCP Server (Recommended for Claude Code)
- **Plugin**: [`obsidian-claude-code-mcp`](https://github.com/iansinnott/obsidian-claude-code-mcp)
- **Pros**: Auto-discovery in Claude Code, no API key management, WebSocket support
- **Cons**: Requires separate plugin, newer approach

#### 2. CLI Tools
- **Tool**: [`obsidian-cli`](https://github.com/Yakitrak/obsidian-cli) or others
- **Pros**: Command-line native, good for shell scripts
- **Cons**: Less feature-rich than REST API

#### 3. Direct File System Access
- **Method**: Read/write markdown files directly
- **Pros**: No plugins needed, simple
- **Cons**: Bypasses Obsidian features, risk of corruption

**Comparison**:

| Method | Setup | Features | Real-time | Auth |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|------|
| REST API | Plugin + API key | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Polling | API Key |
| MCP Server | Plugin | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | WebSocket | MCP |
| CLI Tools | Binary install | ⭐⭐⭐ | No | Varies |
| File System | None | ⭐⭐ | No | None |

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to Obsidian API"
- Verify Obsidian is running
- Check the Local REST API plugin is enabled
- Test connection: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OBSIDIAN_SKILL_API_KEY" https://localhost:27124/`

### "Authentication failed"
- Verify API key is correct: `echo $OBSIDIAN_SKILL_API_KEY`
- Check the key matches the one in Obsidian's plugin settings
- Regenerate the API key if needed

### "Note not found"
- Check path format: no leading slash, use forward slashes
- Ensure `.md` extension is included
- Verify the note exists in your vault

### SSL Certificate Errors
- The skill sets `verify=False` by default for self-signed certs
- If you encounter issues, try using HTTP endpoint: `http://localhost:27123`

### Skill Not Loading
- Check skill is in the correct directory: `~/.claude/skills/obsidian-vault/`
- Verify `SKILL.md` file exists and has proper YAML frontmatter
- For Claude Code: Restart or start a new conversation
- For Claude Desktop: Re-upload the skill zip file

### Missing Documentation
- Documentation (docs/ folder) is not included in skill installations
- Access full docs at: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/obsidian-vault-skill/tree/main/docs
- OpenAPI spec, ADRs, and endpoint guides available in GitHub repo

## Development

### Customizing the Skill

1. Review Architecture Decision Records:
   - `docs/ADR-001-skill-architecture.md` - Initial design decisions
   - `docs/ADR-002-destructive-operation-guardrails.md` - Safety guardrails
   - `docs/ADR-003-automatic-backup-system.md` - Automatic backups
   - `docs/ADR-004-skill-md-design.md` - SKILL.md structure and design
   - `docs/destructive-operation-list.md` - All destructive operations
2. Edit `SKILL.md` to modify:
   - Available capabilities
   - Example code
   - Workflows
   - Safety restrictions

3. Test changes by asking Claude to use the skill

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Areas for improvement:
- Additional workflow examples
- Enhanced error handling
- Support for more Obsidian plugins (Templater, etc.)
- MCP server variant of this skill
- Tests and validation

## Security

### API Key Safety
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables or config files (in `.gitignore`)
- Rotate keys periodically
- Restrict Claude Code file permissions if needed (`.claude/settings.json`)

### Vault Integrity
- The skill can modify your vault - review changes carefully
- Consider backups before batch operations
- Test workflows on a copy of your vault first

### Network Security
- The API runs on localhost - no external exposure by default
- HTTPS provides encryption for local traffic
- API key authentication prevents unauthorized access
